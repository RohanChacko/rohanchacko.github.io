I am an MS in Computer Vision graduate at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. I received my B.Tech (Hons.) in CSE from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India where I pursued research in computer vision under [Dr. P.J. Narayanan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/) (Director, IIIT-H) and [Dr. Avinash Sharma](https://sites.google.com/site/asharmaresearch/) at the [Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). My work focused on textured 3D reconstruction of humans from monocular images using non-parametric shape representations.

I had the opportunity to intern under [Dr. David Held](http://davheld.github.io/) at the [Robots Perceiving and Doing](https://r-pad.github.io/) Lab, Carnegie Mellon University over Summer 2020. My work focused on zero-shot object segmentation methods for robot grasping applications.

My overall research goal is to exploit contextuality from sensory data to improve 3D scene understanding. My research interests broadly include 3D vision, human reconstruction, neural rendering, and graphics.

*I am seeking Computer Vision internships for Summer 2022. Please reach out via email for potential opportunities.*
