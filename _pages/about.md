I am a Masters in Computer Vision graduate from Carnegie Mellon University. At CMU, I worked with Prof. Aswin S. in the [Image Science Lab](http://imagesci.ece.cmu.edu/) exploring the domains of neural rendering and computational photography. I completed a research internship with the Virtual Humans team at TikTok R&D during the summer 2022 where I worked on a generative model for clothed full-body virtual humans.

Prior to CMU, I received my B.Tech (Hons.) in CS from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India where I pursued research in computer vision under [Dr. P.J. Narayanan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/) (Director, IIIT-H) and [Dr. Avinash Sharma](https://sites.google.com/site/asharmaresearch/) at the [Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). My work focused on 3D reconstruction of humans from single-view images using non-parametric shape representations.

My research interests broadly include 3D vision, virtual humans, neural rendering, and graphics.

*I am seeking full-time roles in Computer Vision and Machine Learning starting January 2023. Please reach out via email for potential opportunities.*
