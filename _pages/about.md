I am a senior year CS undergraduate at the [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H)](https://iiit.ac.in). I am currently pursuing my honors research in computer vision under [Dr. P.J. Narayanan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/) (Director, IIIT-H) and [Dr. Avinash Sharma](https://sites.google.com/site/asharmaresearch/) at the [Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). My work focuses on textured 3D reconstruction of humans from monocular images using non-parametric shape representations.

I had the opportunity to intern under [Dr. David Held](http://davheld.github.io/) at the [Robots Perceiving and Doing](https://r-pad.github.io/) Lab, Carnegie Mellon University over Summer 2020. My work focused on zero-shot object segmentation methods for robot grasping applications.

My overall research goal is to exploit contextuality from sensory data to improve 3D scene understanding. My research interests broadly include 3D vision, human reconstruction, neural rendering, and graphics.
